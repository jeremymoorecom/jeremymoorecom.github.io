I love "Best of" and "Top of" lists. I know from reading other blogs that these types of lists draw a lot of clicks.

One thing that I really hate (and am seeing a lot more of) are these lists where it stands out that the person simply put together a list. Period! No research or evaluation just googled and made a list.

I'm seeing more and more of these lists with titles like "16 Best Responsive CSS Frameworks" and "Top 20 PHP Frameworks".

I'm sorry - if you have a list of 16 frameworks and they're the "Best" then you need to raise your standards (PLEASE). Top 20 PHP frameworks - really?!?! I had heard of 99% of these frameworks, but only installed and worked with 4 or 5 to checkout. Tell me again how all 20 of these are the TOP framework!!

I read one that was a top list for php frameworks and included items that were not even frameworks AND did not even include the top two frameworks in existence.

I'm not trying to stop people from making these kind of posts, but please if you're writing a "Best of" or "Top of" article then don't list everything you find in the first 5 pages of google results.

Yes, you might be getting some quick clicks and you might have saved somebody some google time, but you're not doing anything in regards to your credibility behind the given subject matter when you're listing everything under the sun.
