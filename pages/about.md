Hello and welcome to my small corner of the web.

My name is Jeremy, I've been working the web since early 2000.

I'm a senior web developer and programmer at a school for kids with special needs.

In addition to website development, I manage the web and database servers, database cluster and elasticsearch engine. I also work on some of our IOS apps.

I write about linux, web development and javascript. I write about things I've learned from the time I've been developing websites and the tools used to make my life in doing so easier.
